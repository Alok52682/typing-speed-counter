                    </h2>
                    <p><span class="font-bold">Global Scope:</span> The variables defined outside of any function or
                        curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the
                        variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can
                        access that variable.<br>
                        <span class="font-semibold">Example : </span> <br>
                        var name = "linuxHint"; <br>

                        function printName(){<br>
                        // the variable can be accessed inside here<br>
                        console.log("This tutorial is by "+name);<br>
                        }<br>

                        printName(); <br>

                        Output: This tutorial is by linuxHint
                    </p>

                    <!-- Block Scope -->
                    <span class="font-bold">Block Scope :</span> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The
                    block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these
                    curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed
                    to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.<br>
                    Imagine a nested situation : A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{} containing some block
                    variables. <br>
                    { <br>
                    let a = 10;<br>
                    const b = 5;<br>
                    } <br>
                    This block of code is itself inside a function. <br>
                    function addition() { <br>
                    { <br>
                    let a = 10; <br>
                    const b = 5; <br>
                    } <br>
                    } <br>
                    Now when we try to access the variables from inside the function but outside of that specific block.

                    <h2 class="text-center text-4xl mb-10">How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?
                    </h2>
                    <p>There are three major sections to the execution workflow of any JavaScript program, the call
                        stack, the web API, and the Task queue.
                    </p>


                    <p><span class="font-bold">The Call Stack :</span>A stack is a data structure in which the last
                        element added is always the first to be removed from the stack, you could think of it as a stack
                        of a plate in which only the first plate which was the last added can be removed first. A Call
                        Stack is simply nothing but a stack data structure where tasks or code is being executed
                        accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="font-bold">The Web API :</span>This is where code that isn’t handled by the V8
                        engine is executed to not “block” the main execution thread. When the Call Stack encounters a
                        web API function, the process is immediately handed over to the Web API, where it is being
                        executed and freeing the Call Stack to perform other operations during its execution. <br>

                        Let’s go back to our setTimeout example above; <br>

                        When we run the code, the first console.log line gets pushed to the stack and we get our output
                        almost immediately, on getting to the timeout, timers are handled by browser and aren’t a part
                        of V8’s core implementation, it’s get pushed to the Web API instead, freeing the stack so it
                        could perform other operations. <br>

                        While the timeout is still running, the stack goes ahead to the next line of action and runs the
                        last console.log, which explains why we get that outputted before the timer output. Once the
                        timer is completed, something happens. The console.log in then timer magically appears in the
                        call stack again! <br>

                        how?
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="font-bold">The Event Loop :</span>Before we discuss the event loop, lets first go
                        through the function of the task queue. <br>

                        Back to our timeout example, once the Web API finishes executing the task, it doesn’t just push
                        it back to the Call Stack automatically. It goes to the Task Queue. <br>

                        A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get
                        pushed into the queue, they get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web
                        API’s, which are being pushed to the Task Queue, then go back to the Call Stack to get their
                        result printed out. <br>
                        The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks
                        from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and
                        checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack,
                        waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="font-bold">Conclusion :</span>While this is a very basic introduction, the concept
                        of asynchronous programming in JavaScript gives enough insight to clearly understand what is
                        going on under the hood and how JavaScript is able to run concurrently and asynchronously with
                        just a single thread.

                        JS ?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="">An undefined variable or anything without a value will always return
                        "undefined" in JavaScript.
                        This is not the same as null, despite the fact that both imply an empty state. <br>
                        You'll typically assign a value to a variable after you declare it, but this is not always the
                        case. <br>
                        When a variable is declared or initialized but no value is assigned to it, JavaScript
                        automatically displays "undefined". It looks like this: <br>
                        let myStr;<br>

                        console.log(myStr); // undefined <br>
                        Also, when you try accessing values in, for example, an array or object that doesn’t exist, it
                        will throw undefined. <br>
                        let user = { <br>
                        name: "John Doe", <br>
                        age: 14 <br>
                        };<br>

                        console.log(user.hobby); // undefined <br>
                        Here's another example: <br>

                        let myArr = [12, 33, 44];<br>

                        console.log(myArr[7]); // undefined <br>
                        In this article, you will learn the various methods and approaches you can use to know if a
                        variable is undefined in JavaScript. This is necessary if you want to avoid your code throwing
                        errors when performing an operation with an undefined variable. <br>

                        In case you are in a rush, here are the three standard methods that can help you check if a
                        variable is undefined in JavaScript: <br>

                        if(myStr === undefined){} <br>
                        if(typeof myArr[7] === "undefined"){} <br>
                        if(user.hobby === void 0){} <br>
                        Let’s now explain each of these methods in more detail. <br>


                    </p>


                    <p><span class="font-bold">How to Check if a Variable is Undefined in JavaScript with Direct
                            Comparison</span>One of the first methods that comes to mind is direct comparison. This is
                        where you compare the output to see if it returns undefined. You can easily do this in the
                        following way: <br>

                        let user = {<br>
                        name: "John Doe",<br>
                        age: 14<br>
                        };<br>

                        if (user.hobby === undefined) {<br>
                        console.log("This is undefined");<br>
                        }<br>
                        This also works for arrays as you can see below:<br>

                        let scores = [12, 34, 66, 78];<br>

                        if (scores[10] === undefined) {<br>
                        console.log("This is undefined");<br>
                        }
                        And it definitely also works for other variables:<br>

                        let name;<br>

                        if (name === undefined) {<br>
